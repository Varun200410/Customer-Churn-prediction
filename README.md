# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, helping organizations take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Provide insights into key factors influencing customer churn.
- Deliver a reproducible pipeline for training and testing models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning models)
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (development environment)

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Import dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize customer behavior and identify churn-related trends.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create meaningful features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and compare performance.

5. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   Package the model for deployment in production environments.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy and precision in predicting churn.
- Identified key drivers of churn such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
